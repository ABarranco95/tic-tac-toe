What did you think of this deliverable?: I'm starting to get more used to CSS and definitely HTML. I could've made it look way better if i am being honest but I wanted to get the functionality and basics first before polishing it. In the end this is all I could do . Part of my brain undertands the concept but the other part gave up on me. I will probably try to look for more DOM elements and function practice to help me out.
